        <h2>What is Ohm's Law</h2>
        <img src="Ohm.jpg" width="300">
        <p>Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points.</p>

        <h3>About Ohm's Law</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>It is generally applied only to direct current (DC) circuits, not alternating current (AC) circuits. In AC circuits, because the current is constantly changing, other factors such as capacitance and inductance must be taken into account</li>
            <li>The concept behind Ohm's law was first explained by German Physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Ohm">George Ohm</a> who the law is also named after.</li>
            <li>The tool for measuring volts in an electric circuit is called a voltmeter.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The 3 building blocks of Ohm's Law</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Voltage</strong>-the difference in charge between 2 points</li>
            <li><strong>Current</strong>-rate at which charge is flowing</li>
            <li><strong>Resistance</strong>-material's tendency to resist the flow of current</li>
        </ol>
